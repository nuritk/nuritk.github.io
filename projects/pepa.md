summary: "Often, tangible user interfaces use non-idiomatic forms of interaction. For this project, I was intersted in understanding such an interaction - bend gestures. I designed and developed interactive bendable game cards called PEPA (Paper-like Entertainment Platform Agents) and tried to understand if an application works well with bend gestures."
