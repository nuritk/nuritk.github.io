In Fall 2016 I taught CM 315 *Interactive Applications* in the Creative Media department of the West Oahu university campus. The class was tailored to students with little to no prior programming experience. The class students successfully created two individual projects. From the class syllabus:

> In this class we will learn about the process of designing, prototyping, user testing and creating interactive applications for mobile devices. We will learn to create applications using the CoronaSDK and Lua language, and will complete two projects throughout the course - an interactive story application and a game application.

Each class included a section on interactive applications' design and a section on Lua programming. Slides are available here (all materials written by me).
